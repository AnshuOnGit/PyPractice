The most important thing is to feel confident using python. Learning something as potentially complicated as graphics programming will be a real chore if you’re also unfamiliar with the language you’re using. Write a few sizable non-graphical programs in python – parse some text files, write a guessing game or a journal-entry program or something. Get comfortable with string and list manipulation – know how to split, slice and combine strings and lists. Know how import works – try writing a program that is spread across several source files. Write your own functions, and practice manipulating numbers and characters; know how to convert between the two. Get to the point where the syntax for using lists and dictionaries is second-nature – you don’t want to have to run to the documentation every time you need to slice a list or sort a set of keys. Resist the temptation to run to a mailing list, comp.lang.python, or irc when you run into trouble. Instead, fire up the interpreter and play with the problem for a few hours. Print out the Python 2.0 Quick Reference and keep it by your computer.

This may sound incredibly dull, but the confidence you’ll gain through your familiarity with python will work wonders when it comes time to write your game. The time you spend making python code second-nature will be nothing compared to the time you’ll save when you’re writing real code.
